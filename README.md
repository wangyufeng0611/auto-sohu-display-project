For beginners like me to learn the concepts in [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux)

Can it be simpler? send a pull request

To run this example:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. open http://localhost:3000/ in the browser

And also head over to http://gaearon.github.io/redux/ for some great documentation.

There is also a [webpack](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example/tree/webpack) and an [ES5](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example/tree/es5) example.
